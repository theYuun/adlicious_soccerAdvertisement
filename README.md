# adlicious_soccerAdvertisement

A small task to create a interactive advertisement for adlicious with a soccer theme.
Use **HTML5**, **CSS** and **Javascript**.

>
The goal: Make an interactive banner in which the user has to interact with the banner to trigger actions. We mean more than animations, we mean interactions like hovering with the mouse to move the ball or using clicks to move the goalkeeper. You can do any interaction that you want and can add other assets, like for example a goal counter or other players or more balls for the user to play with. Is up to you! We want to see your creativity! Do not focus on the design, focus on coding interactions.
If we like what we see an interview will follow in the next 1-2 days.

We are looking forward to see your gamifications!

Best,
Doris Pfaff
